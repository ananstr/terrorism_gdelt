The king of Eurovision has shared his thoughts on Remember Monday

Graham Norton praised UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, for being ""flawless"" just days ahead of the Grand Finals.

As Eurovision returns to its home country, Switzerland, the icon of Eurovision is also back for another year. He'll be hosting the BBC's coverage of the final on Saturday May 17.

‌



Graham will oversee proceedings from the commentary box in the arena for audiences watching at home, as 26 countries, including the United Kingdom, vie for the number one spot of being crowned Eurovision champion.

‌



Nemo won last year, hence why the biggest singing competition in Europe will be hosted in Basel.

Speaking about the final, Graham admitted: ""I know nothing about the plans for the Grand Final yet, but when it's a country like Switzerland that haven't hosted for 36 years, I suspect they are going to pull out all the stops! I can't wait to see what they have in store.""

Before the final 26 contestants are chosen, they have to compete in the semi-final rounds that take place on Tuesday, May 13, and Thursday, May 15.

The ""Big Five"" already have a place secured in the final, meaning that the United Kingdom will be on that stage come Saturday night.

‌



Graham shared: ""Remember Monday have a great advantage in that they are unlike any other act this year. Their vocals and harmonies are flawless, the song has a very strong hook and the trio are hugely likeable. With a decent place in the running order they should do very well indeed.""

However, he also sees some potential in other acts, as he continued: ""It's a big year for party anthems and the two that stand out for me are Miriana Conte representing Malta, and EMMY for Ireland with an unlikely banger about an immortal dog.

""Cutting through all the noise I think Italy might have a good year with a classic rock ballad performed by Lucio Corsi.""

The attack Sunday evening in Texistepec killed Yesenia Lara Gutíerrez, 49, who was running for mayor of the town of 20,000.

At least three other people were killed in the attack, authorities said. Three others were wounded.

Video of the campaign event at which the attack occurred showed a chaotic scene of people running for cover as about 20 gunshots rang out in the streets amid the rally. Media reports indicated that at least three people opened fire.

Lara, 49, was at least the second mayoral candidate killed this year in Veracruz, a violence-ridden state that is having mayoral elections in more than 200 municipalities on June 1.

Lara's husband, Enrique Arugüelles, a former city council member in Texistepec, was shot dead in 2022.

On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that police were trying to track down the killers of Lara, who was running under the banner of Sheinbaum's ruling Morena political bloc.

""We don't know the motive,"" Sheinbaum told reporters at her regular morning news conference.

State authorities in Veracruz were heading the investigation, the president said. Texistepec is about 125 miles southeast of the port city of Veracruz.

Veracruz Gov. Rocío Nahle García condemned the attack and vowed there would be no impunity. ""No office or post is worth the life of a person,"" the governor wrote on social media, calling the slayings ""cowardly.""

Also on June 1, Mexico is holding nationwide balloting for the election of hundreds of judges — part of a controversial constitutional reform backed by Sheinbaum and her predecessor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Lara's slaying again underscores the problem of electoral violence in Mexico, where last year's national elections resulted in scores of killings of candidates.

Campaign rallies and other public appearances can leave candidates especially exposed despite police protection. During last year’s elections, slain candidates included a mayoral aspirant stabbed to death in the gulf coast state of Tamaulipas after a breakfast event, and mayoral hopefuls shot dead during campaign stops in the states of Guerrero and Guanajuato.

Organized crime seeks to control local mayors, whose responsibilities include police forces, budgets and contracts, experts say.

""Mayors and mayoral candidates are essentially under siege because they are a critical point of influence and protection for criminal actors,"" David Shirk, a political scientist at the University of San Diego, told The Times last year.

In a report on political violence this month, the Mexican consulting firm Integralia said that organized crime sought to ""capture public local institutions.""

""The threats and attempts against candidates are meant to influence electoral results,"" the firm concluded. ""Meantime, the kidnappings and threats against officials serve as mechanisms of territorial and financial control.""

Like Lara's slaying, other political killings also have been carried out in public. The killing of Rosa Alma Barragán, in the town of Moroleon in Guanajuato is just one example.

Barragán, who was running for mayor, was killed at a campaign event in 2021 when gunmen sprayed a crowd with bullets.

Hours before her slaying, Lara published a profie of herself on social media, vowing that, if elected, she would aid the poor and young of the town.

""The force and vitality of our young motivates me to keep on walking from day to day,"" she wrote.

Southern California authorities conducted dozens of emergency rescues during an early-season mini heat wave over the weekend.

Amid record temperatures, the Orange County Fire Authority said fire officials and other agencies had partnered to conduct operations, including one captured on video in Aliso and Woods Canyons Wilderness Park.

“Over a dozen people have been rescued collectively,” it wrote in a post on Facebook.

The agency noted that it was 96 degrees Fahrenheit by mid-afternoon in the city of Aliso Viejo. The heat wave was swift, jumping to as many as 20 degrees above normal around Los Angeles County, according to the National Weather Service.

Conditions led the Orange County Fire Authority to urge inexperienced bike riders and hikers to wait to enter the terrain until the weather cooled.

“If you do head out, please bring plenty of hydration with you,” it advised.

Multiple hikers were caught off guard across the region.

A 55-year-old woman who was hiking in the Hollywood Hills and was weak from heat exhaustion was also taken to the hospital in a helicopter. The Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed the rescue to The Independent on Monday, saying her condition was “fair.”

Another hiker in Riverside County was stranded and dehydrated. Riverside County firefighters also hoisted the patient out of the area using a helicopter. They were transported to a local area hospital in an ambulance with “critical injuries.”

More rescues were reported in Riverside County and Anaheim, according to The Los Angeles Times. No other information about the hikers was provided.

The life-saving efforts came after forecasters warned about the hottest weekend of the year.

On Saturday, the high temperature calendar day record was broken in Woodland Hills, up from 99 degrees in 1984 to 102 degrees. Paso Robles missed their record by just one degree. On Sunday, Woodland Hills and Downtown Los Angeles reached record highs again. Temperatures eased by the end of the weekend.

In nearby Arizona, one person died and several other hikers were rescued in sweltering weather. The unidentified hiker was 33 years old, according to The Arizona Republic.

In the West and Southwest, temperatures are projected to be above or leaning above average this summer, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Climate change is making hot temperatures hotter and dry conditions drier, as Earth continues to trap planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in its atmosphere. Last year was the hottest year on record. Temperatures and no rain fueled this year’s deadly Los Angeles County wildfires.

“We are seeing much more rapid warming of inland areas that were already hotter to begin with,” UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain told Cal Matters last year."

JB Pritzker that threatened a $1.2 billion plan to keep invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes appears to have been settled after the Trump administration offered assurances it will cover its share of the costs.

After a delay that has stretched on since February, Illinois officials are set to resume closing on property they need to continue work on a project that will generate vast bubble curtains to deter the carp, stun them with electrical fields and play sound frequencies to disorient them.

Here's what to know:

The project has been on the drawing board for years

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers along with state officials in Illinois and Michigan have been planning since 2020 to install a gantlet of technologies in the Des Plaines River near Joliet, Illinois, to deter invasive carp from entering Lake Michigan.

The Corps and the states signed a deal in 2024 to work together on the project using $226 million allocated through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And elements of the Water Resources Development Act adopted last year call for the federal government to cover 90% of operating and maintenance costs.

Pritzker demands assurances from Trump

Construction on the project began in January. Pritzker's administration was set to close in February on a parcel of property for the project and transfer it to the Corps.

Everything appeared on track until late January, when the Trump administration froze federal grants and loans as it reviewed whether spending aligned with Trump's priorities on issues such as climate change and diversity. The administration rescinded the freeze less than two days later but questions persist about the federal government's spending commitments.

Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel empire and a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, is one of Trump’s fiercest critics. He has described the early months of the Trump administration as “true villainous cruelty by a few idiots.”

Days before Illinois was to finalize a property deal for the carp project, Pritzker hit pause and demanded assurances that the federal government would honor its spending commitment. Site preparation has continued since then, but substantial work to install technology has been on hold.

Trump signals the project is a priority

The White House issued a memo late Friday saying the Trump administration recognized the threat invasive carp pose to Great Lakes recreation and fishing and that it's committed to protecting the lakes.

The federal government is prepared to do its part so long as states cooperate, according to the memo, which calls on Illinois to complete the property deal by July 1 and promises the federal government will streamline permitting and environmental reviews.

“My Administration fully supports preventing the spread of invasive carp,” the memo said. “The State of Illinois, where the (project) is located, must cease further delay in cooperating with this effort, for the sake of its own citizens and economy and for the sake of all of the Great Lake States.”

Pritzker's office issued a news release late Friday evening saying the governor was satisfied.

Work on the project isn't slated to finish until 2032, but Joel Brammeier, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Alliance for the Great Lakes, said Monday that prospects suddenly look dramatically better than they did last week.

“We're back to business as usual. That's a good thing,” he said.

Why the carp would be bad news for the Great Lakes

Four species of carp were imported to the U.S. from Asia in the 1960s and 1970s to clear algae from sewage ponds and fish farms in the Deep South. They escaped into the Mississippi River and have moved north into dozens of tributaries in the central U.S.

Government agencies, advocacy groups and others have long debated how to prevent the fish from reaching the Great Lakes, where scientists say they could out-compete native species for food and habitat in waterways where the fishing industry is valued at $7 billion.

A shipping canal that forms part of the link between the Mississippi and Lake Michigan has a network of fish-repelling barriers, which the Corps says is effective, but critics consider inadequate.

The new project at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam on the Des Plaines River near Joliet will provide another layer of protection at a downstream choke point between the Illinois River, which is infested with invasive carp, and Lake Michigan.

“I’m hopeful everyone is taking this project seriously now and we’re not going to see any more delays,” Brammeier said."

(WKRN) — The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee has filed a petition to challenge the state’s laws about driver licenses and other state identification for transgender Tennesseans.

In 2023, Tennessee passed a bill defining “sex” as anatomy at birth. Additionally, last year a federal appeals court ruled that there is no fundamental right to change sex on a birth certificate. In Tennessee, all identifying documentation—including driver licenses—must match; all transgender Tennesseans change the marker on their identifying documents if it does not match their birth certificate.

The ACLU-TN originally filed a petition to challenge the state’s driver license rule in April 2024 on behalf of “Jane Doe,” whose identity has been withheld due to safety concerns. The Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security—one of the defendants in the case—did not issue accurate identification documents, according to the ACLU, and caused her significant harm.

Chrissy Miller later joined the case as a plaintiff. ACLU-TN said that while Miller was successfully able to change the sex designation on her driver’s license, the state department told her that she has to surrender it or face losing driving privileges. Last September, the court ordered the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security to evaluate its actions and determine whether the agency stood by them.

A hearing was held in January, and the Department affirmed its actions; the plaintiffs then asked the Department to stop enforcing the rule while the court heard arguments in the case. The department reportedly refused, resulting in a new court filing Monday.

“All people deserve the freedom to live their lives safely and with dignity,” ACLU-TN Senior Attorney Lucas Cameron-Vaughn said in a press release. “Our clients need accurate identification documents in order to travel for work and family, to vote, and to engage in everyday life like everyone else. Forcing them to carry identification that contradicts who they are—or else withholding that identification altogether—is cruel, unfair and unlawful.”

It's his former defense lawyer.,"Todd Blanche, the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, has been appointed as the acting Librarian of Congress by President Trump, according to a spokesperson at the Department of Justice.

The permanent post of Librarian of Congress must be confirmed by the Senate.

Blanche has no experience working in libraries or archives, according to his public profile . Now he will be running the largest one in the world. As a lawyer, he has focused on investigations and criminal litigation, including work for the President. Blanche served as one of Trump's personal lawyers, leading the defense in last year's criminal trial in which the President was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a payment to an adult film star.

An employee at the Librarian of Congress, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution, said two men showed up this morning with a letter saying that Blanche was appointed the acting Librarian of Congress, Brian Nieves was appointed acting assistant librarian, and Paul Perkins was appointed the acting Register of Copyrights and Director of the Copyright Office. The men were not allowed into offices and left soon after, the employee said, adding that the Library of Congress is a legislative branch agency, and has not yet received direction from Congress on how to move forward.

Last Thursday, Trump fired the former Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden. She had been targeted by conservative groups who accused her of promoting ""wokeness."" Hayden was the 14th person to hold the post and the first professional librarian to hold the post since 1974.

A speed limiter device, like this one, will be required for repeat speeding offenders under a Washington law signed on May 12, 2025. The law doesn't take effect until 2029. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)

In a few years, with the help of technology, prolific speeders in Washington won’t be able to drive as fast as they want.

Gov. Bob Ferguson on Monday signed House Bill 1596 into law, requiring a new speed-limiting device as a condition to getting a restricted driver’s license after getting it suspended for reckless driving or excessive speeding.

Judges can also require the speed limiters as a condition of pre-trial release or post-conviction probation.

The tech, shown at a demonstration at the Capitol on Monday, is similar to ignition interlock devices that require people with histories of drunk driving to blow into a breathalyzer to show their blood alcohol concentration before they can start the car.

These new devices use GPS to restrict speed to the posted limit. Under the legislation, drivers could override the limiter three times per month.

The bill received bipartisan support in the Legislature as the state aims to turn the tide on traffic deaths after reaching a 33-year high in 2023. Of the 809 deaths that year, a third involved speeding drivers.

“What’s behind this bill is a really simple goal, which is to save lives,” Ferguson said.

The new law is known as the BEAM Act, named after four people killed in a crash last year with a speeding driver near Renton: Boyd Buster Brown, Eloise Wilcoxson, Andrea Smith Hudson and Matilda Wilcoxson.

Last month, a judge sentenced the driver in the case to 17½ years in prison after he pleaded guilty to four counts of vehicular homicide in the high-speed crash.

The driver was held up as an example of someone who would’ve needed to install a speed limiter. In the prior 10 months, he had reportedly been involved in two crashes in which his speeding was a factor.

Before signing the BEAM Act, the governor met with families of those killed in that crash and others who are pushing for stronger traffic safety measures.

“It’s the family members who got us to this day,” said prime sponsor Rep. Mari Leavitt, D-University Place. “They’re the ones who were willing to share their story over and over again.”

In Europe, new vehicles are required to have intelligent speed assistance technology installed.

But in the United States, the speed limiter idea is new.

Last month, Virginia became the first state to enact such legislation, requiring intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers convicted of going over 100 mph. Georgia quickly followed, with a bill awaiting the governor’s signature.

Last year, Washington, D.C. approved a “speed governor” requirement for repeat offenders.

Lawmakers in several other states have also considered the requirement. In California last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a measure requiring passive speed limiters.

Washington’s legislation defines excessive speeding as 20 mph above speed limits over 40 mph, or 10 mph above speed limits under that threshold.

If a driver has a history of moving violations, including excessive speeding, they would have to use an intelligent speed assistance device for 120 days after getting their license back from a suspension. In reckless driving cases, that rises to 150 days. Driving without one during this probationary period would be a traffic infraction that could add 30 days to a license suspension.

Tampering with the device is a gross misdemeanor.

Drivers would have to pay to install and remove the speed limiter, and an additional $21 per month. That monthly fee would go to the state Department of Licensing to offset the costs for low-income people who need the devices but can’t afford them.

The legislation doesn’t go into effect until Jan. 1, 2029."

When Michelada Festival canceled its 2025 festival last week over the uncertainty around artist visas, the situation rang the alarm for several other Latin music festivals around the country.

Michelada, a Chicago-based event, became the first of its kind to cancel over the “rapidly changing political climate.” The festival wrote on May 6, “We’re no longer able to guarantee the full experience we had dreamed up for you with all your favorite artists. Although we tried to push through, it became clear that we wouldn’t be able to deliver the full lineup as planned.”

Just a month earlier, organizers had unveiled a lineup that included Grupo Firme, Luis R. Conriquez, Los Alegres Del Barranco, and Netón Vega. They quickly replaced Los Alegres — whose visas were revoked by the State Department over their depiction of a cartel kingpin at a show in Mexico — with Gabito Ballesteros. But with visa statuses for both Ballesteros and Conriquez now uncertain, organizers were forced to act quickly and cancel the event altogether.

“It’s not fair to the consumer to go through those changes,” says Miguel Torres, one of Michelada’s owners. “You want to deliver on what you promise, and not create the question of, ‘Will the artist be there or not?’”

“It was too big of a gamble and a risk to move forward,” adds Fernando Nieto, Michelada’s co-founder.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has made securing work visas incredibly difficult for international artists. (FKA Twigs canceled a U.S. run over the issue.) And, on top of that, there’s a growing fear of visa revocations among artists who perform narcocorridos, over what happened to Los Alegres del Barranco. At the time of Los Alegres’ revocation, Deputy Secretary Christopher Landau accused the group of “glorifying” criminals and terrorists with their performances.

Promoter and new Jalo Fest organizer Ricky Calderon has also had to deal with these issues in the last few weeks. Calderon noticed how difficult securing visas has become under the presidential administration for many artists, and moved quickly to address the problems at two of his own events last month. The organizer had booked both Alegres del Barranco and Gabito Ballesteros for a pair of shows in Northern California in late April. Just days before, he was forced to replace them with other artists.

“Everyone wants to go to these shows, but it really affected us,” Calderon says. “What can I say?”

Calderon says the situation also affects promoters’ credibility with ticket buyers, who are already struggling to cover the rising costs of shows. With the concern around artists being able to stick on the lineup, fans are choosing to wait until closer to the event to purchase tickets.

As he deals with the repercussions at one-off shows, Calderon has also been slowly rolling out Jalo Fest, the first-ever Latin music festival in Sacramento, slated for this summer. He’s already confirmed appearances from El Tri, Tucanes de Tijuana, Eslabón Armado, and Santa Fe Klan, among others, but the visa problems have affected three artists he planned to feature: Alegres, Ballesteros, and Edición Especial. The setback forced him to postpone his fest’s lineup announcement multiple times, preventing his organization from getting a head start on sales.

“We were supposed to announce and go on sale two months back,” Calderón says of the event, scheduled for Aug. 30 and 31. “People don’t want to buy tickets knowing that things might get canceled down the line. It’s really affecting us. It’s a big investment for both the people and also for us as business people.”

After Michelada’s cancellation, it’s unclear how Chicago’s Sueños Fest will fare later this month, given that the lineup prominently features corridos acts such as Peso Pluma, Tito Double P, and Oscar Maydon. BottleRock’s La Onda Fest will also showcase similar artists the following weekend in Napa. (Reps for those festivals did not respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment.)

Abel DeLuna, founder and board member of Latino promoter collective Promotores Unidos, has his act Sonora Tropicana performing at the NorCal event. He says the delay in visa issuance (and the narcocorrido conversation) is unprecedented, and will likely have lasting effects on the industry. As demand for the artists in the genre continues to grow, so too does the uncertainty around booking them.

“I think this is going to affect us as long as this president is in office. And now, with Mexico prohibiting corridos… The government hasn’t prohibited it here, but we’re scared that it could happen,” explains DeLuna. “You never know what to expect with Donald Trump.”

DeLuna says that as an organization, the association of promoters has discussed how to help each other out, but ultimately, “we don’t have a solution to this,” he says. “What we are going through now is something I have never seen before.”

Ramiro Bojorquez, organizer of Belico Fest in Phoenix, which debuted last year with several artists known for their narcocorridos, is proceeding with caution, but remains committed to delivering a top-tier show. After hosting Gerardo Ortiz, Junior H, and Luis R. Conriquez in 2024, he feels a responsibility to keep the Mexican music event alive and ensure it lives up to the “Belico” name.

“I’m investing a lot of money in this and I’m a bit scared, but it’s a passion project for me,” says Bojorquez.

Slowly, he’s been announcing acts confirmed for the fall event: Xavi and Clave Especial, who are all U.S. citizens, and Netón Vega, who had his work visa confirmed last month, he says. Bojorquez “had to pull back” on announcing other acts for the festival, and ultimately decided not to re-book Conriquez, the leader of the belico subgenre.

“We’re very, very cautious about who we book, and not taking away from the whole experience, because our name is based on that genre and culture of Mexican music,” says Bojorquez. “It’s a movement that we started, and now we have to continue. We can’t let government restrictions stop us. We gotta work with what we have and give the audiences what they want.”

As Belico Fest continues filling out their lineup, Bojorquez explains that he’s going to focus on booking artists who are either from the United States or already have their visas confirmed, contending that it’s not worth the risk of having to pull out an artist. “It’s scary because you’re investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a festival and you’re dependent on the outcome of the festival,” he says.

Bojorquez also pointed to a troubling double standard that seems to specifically target Mexican musicians, while other media portraying narcoculture, like Netflix’s Narcos, which explores the drug trade and depicts cartel kingpins, face no scrutiny.

“I can’t stay quiet. I can’t keep my arms closed,” says Bojorquez. “It’s happening on Netflix and in other parts of the media. You can’t blindfold people because you don’t like the way they talk.”

ATLANTA – Schools across Georgia will have to figure out how to pry cellphones from students’ hands next year now that a new ban will be taking effect.

House Bill 340 prohibits personal communications devices in public school classrooms from kindergarten through eighth grade.

The ban goes into effect in the summer of 2026. Gov. Brian Kemp signed the legislation last week after it passed the Georgia General Assembly with broad bipartisan support earlier this year.

A handful of school systems have already implemented local bans, including Marietta City Schools.

Marietta Superintendent Grant Rivera was among the leading proponents for a statewide ban, telling lawmakers in March that he’d seen dramatic changes in middle school, where students were talking with each other rather than hunching over screens.

“It impacts academics, it impacts their well-being, it impacts their relationships,” Rivera said at a legislative hearing. He said disciplinary issues were down, as well.

School districts have until January to write policies and procedures for locking up students’ phones from the first bell in the morning to the last one in the afternoon.

They must implement those policies by July 1, 2026, with hundreds of thousands of students affected when school starts that fall.

School leaders welcome the legislation. John Zauner, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association, called the ban a well-meaning attempt to remove a major distraction during the school day.

“Cellphones in the hands of youngsters are definitely a distraction,” he said.

Fulton County School System, one of the largest school districts in Georgia, is already preparing.

“These new restrictions were already planned for the upcoming school year, and the new law affirms the direction we were taking to reduce distractions and strengthen student learning,” a district spokesman said. School board members will vote on the new policy in June. It not only would ban use during the school day through eighth grade, but also would prohibit use in high schools during instructional time.

While the idea of a statewide ban is popular, some have expressed concern about being unable to reach their children during an emergency, such as a school shooting.

That’s why the bill’s chief co-sponsor, Rep. Scott Hilton, R-Peachtree Corners, didn’t push for a ban in high schools. But he and others expect the K-8 ban to spread to high schools in the future, after middle school students and their parents become accustomed to it.

Hilton said in an interview Monday that high school is more complicated, and it will take time to study implementation there and to develop a cellphone-free culture.

“I think this bill begins an important conversation that’s going to lead to a cellphone-free environment in grades 9 through 12,” he said.

That culture is deeply embedded. Hilton said that when Kemp signed HB 340 on Friday, lawmakers instinctively pulled out their smartphones to capture the moment. And Hilton said that when he was presenting his bill on the floor of the House of Representatives, his colleagues couldn’t resist the moment.

“My phone starts to light up,” he said. “People are calling, texting — and it’s my colleagues in the House having fun with me. It was distracting.”"
